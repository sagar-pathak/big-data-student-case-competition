# Big Data Student Case Competition
This is the repository for the Big Data Student Case Competition. We were the finalists out of 30 teams nationwide. 

## Result: We (Hungry Stayers) became finalist in the competition

The USC National Big Data Health Science Student Case Competition provides enthusiastic teams of graduate and/or senior undergraduate students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge to the analysis of big datasets in healthcare.
The National Big Data Health Science Case Competition is held virtually before the University of South Carolina’s Annual National Big Data Health Science Conference, which takes place in February every year. This competition is designed to be a data science experience in healthcare for undergraduate or graduate students. Participating teams will be given the same business problem, datasets, and access to software to solve a challenging problem using a data analytics approach.  A panel of industry and academic experts will judge the presentations based on teams’ use of the full analytics process, from framing the problem to methodology selection, data use, model building, and innovation.
